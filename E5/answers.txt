1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?
   Out of the four transformations suggested, I found that np.sqrt() got me the closest to meeting the assumptions of a T-test.

2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.
    For the original T-test, rejecting the null hypothesis would mean that there is a difference in the total number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays compared to weekends.
    For the transformed data T-test, rejecting the null hypothesis would suggest that even after adjusting for the skewness in the data, there is still a difference in the number of comments between weekdays and weekends. This means the difference remains even after considering the skewness of the data.

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)
    Out of all the approaches, I believe Fix 2 (using the Central Limit Theorem) did the best job of answering the original question. This is because, with this method, the p-value was higher, so the null hypothesis wasn’t rejected. It also makes sense because it combines all weekdays and weekends over time, making the results more reliable.

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?
    In my analysis, more Reddit comments are posted on weekdays in /r/canada on average. However, it’s important to consider that weekdays consist of five days, while weekends consist of only two days, which might affect the average.
