correlation between x and y: 0.9551531665750371
Description: For data-2, we observe a positive correlation between x and y, suggesting a strong linear relationship, where increases in the x variable correspond with increases in the y variable.


Summary for data-3:
mean of x: 0.9689074904200939
mean of y: 8.508535236641327
standard deviation of x: 2.235557861057969
standard deviation of y: 1.1493008110024525
min of x: -2.4490643296742807

max of y: 10.551871022804317
correlation between x and y: 0.9819372646760661
Description: For data-3, the correlation between x and y is strongly positive, indicating that the two variables are highly related and increase together.


Summary for data-4:
mean of x: 49.90508614830509
mean of y: 18.553836525423726
standard deviation of x: 28.50861051988193
standard deviation of y: 16.545896442941682
min of x: 0.0
max of x: 87.3767
min of y: 0.0
max of y: 44.56504
correlation between x and y: -0.08119306735490815
Description: For data-4, the correlation is a slightly negative number, close to zero, which suggests that x and y might not have any linear relation. The dataset likely represents unrelated variables or random scatter.


Summary for data-5:
mean of x: 49.90999357843095
mean of y: 18.555524937729086
standard deviation of x: 28.500000943801354
standard deviation of y: 16.540796301840782
min of x: 4.337892453674525
max of x: 91.0528633396976
min of y: 0.0554975075811517
max of y: 49.93419703633311
correlation between x and y: -0.0882359898305888
Description: For data-5, the weak negative correlation implies that x and y are largely independent of each other, and plotting the data would likely result in scattered, meaningless patterns.


Summary for data-6:
mean of x: 7.21615517960992
mean of y: 7.602215028237295
standard deviation of x: 11.921599067458311
standard deviation of y: 11.764382455006647
min of x: -24.33382075234097
max of x: 35.402138910929
min of y: -22.9563569970746
max of y: 36.07987403078143
correlation between x and y: 0.9350685662094909
Description: For data-6, the high positive correlation indicates a strong linear relationship between x and y, where increases in x are associated with corresponding increases in y.
